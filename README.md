# USGS-Frodolib
FrodoLib from the USGS.

This is part of a series of source that I either used, maintained, or wrote while at the USGS.  I'm putting it here as a sort of historical archive so that the various source repositories do not simply disappear.  As they were developed by the government, they are all under the Public Domain.
